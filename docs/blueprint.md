## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#663399), chosen for its association with knowledge, exploration, and sophistication, reflecting the app's focus on machine learning resources.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0), to ensure readability and reduce eye strain during extended use.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), selected for its contrast with the primary color, providing visual cues for interactive elements without being distracting.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, creating a balance between modern aesthetics and readability. This pairing complements the technical nature of the app's content while maintaining clarity.
- Utilize minimalistic, geometric icons to represent different categories and actions, ensuring visual clarity and a consistent user experience across the app.
- Employ a card-based layout to present models, datasets, and Spaces, with a focus on clean lines, ample whitespace, and a clear visual hierarchy.
- Implement subtle animations for transitions and interactions, such as loading indicators and expanding cards, to enhance user engagement and provide visual feedback.
